# Toplogger Map

Playing around with the Toplogger API to create a map of boulders in a gym

> [!WARNING]
> ðŸš¨ Deprecation Notice ðŸš¨ \
> This project has been archived and is no longer maintained. It was built using the Toplogger API, but since Toplogger fully migrated their API to be GraphQL based, this implementation no longer functions.

## Get started

_Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed._

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:3000). You should see the app running.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) I recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## Building and running in production mode

Build an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```
